#  Patterns

#### Geometric Abstract Art iOS App I'm Currently Working On

These are some screenshots from the app; see my [iOS README](../README.md) for more details on the app. These screenshots are meant to show the types of art the user can create with the app along with showing the main UI on both iPhones and iPads.

- [PatternsiPad1](PatternsiPad1.png): Pattern style grid random (grid of squares/rectangles with them filled randomly with user's selected colors)
- [PatternsiPad2](PatternsiPad2.png): Pattern style random triangles (triangles placed at random locations on the screen)

- [PatternsiPhone1](PatternsiPhone1.png): Pattern style random circles (circles placed at random locations on the screen)
- [PatternsiPhone2](PatternsiPhone2.png): Pattern style grid zig zag (grid of squares/rectangles in a zig zag design)
- [PatternsiPhone3](PatternsiPhone3.png): Pattern style grid zig zag (grid of squares/rectangles in a zig zag design); has the pattern's spacing increased, showing the effect of adjusting that control
- [PatternsiPhone4](PatternsiPhone4.png): Shows where the user selects a pattern type, organized by category
