#  Dynamic Type Visualization
A simple app to test Dynamic Type settings to find the best settings for your app. This app is designed to make it faster for you to prototype these text size settings to find the right one before incorporating them into your actual app.

- Preview Dynamic Type sizes with your app's text for an accurate idea of how the text will appear in your app
- Use Interface Builder to change the text view's background or font colors to your app's custom colors for a more accurate preview
- Preview Dynamic Type sizes with the Larger Text settings (the Accessibility Inspector, which can be opened via Xcode -> Open Developer Tool -> Accessibility Inspector, is an easy way to do this (see [WWDC 2016 session 407 Auditing Your Apps for Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016-407/?time=1713))). All text views and labels in this app work properly with the Larger Text settings.
- Works properly on iPhone X screen

You can use the app by typing text into the text view and then tapping on the Dynamic Type size you'd like to try in the table view above. The labels in the table view cells for each Dynamic Type size are shown in their respective sizes for the current Larger Text setting. This shows you how a piece of text looks at a given Dynamic Type size before you select it.
